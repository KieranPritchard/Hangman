## Project Description

This project is a terminal based verison of hangman. The rules of the game are the same, the only difference is the computer chooses a word from a list and not the user. It works by asking the user for a letter to see if it appears in the word, if all letters are guessed then the user wins. If the letter you guess is not in the word it detucts a try from the "tries" varible, there are 10 tries in total.

The reason behind this project was because, for the 3 - 5 months in the lead up of the 2024 summer GCSE exams I had to stop coding and learning the things I want to. why I had to stop was the school had the students on very tight revision schedule with every lession being what would normally be revision someone would do in their own time at home, unfortunatly they were heavily pushing home learning alongside this method as well so it was very tiring.unfortunatly because the exams automatically override my own study, so I spend this time away from what i would of liked to have done at home. to sum up this project is just so I can start back up with my home studys and passions again, after I long hiatus of learning.

There was a few challenges when I came back to programming as well as this project. these included syntaxs for more advance functionality, list methods, custom functions, and for and while loops. I overcame this by refering back to previous projects i had done, use of the internet to research topics. My main take-away to this, dont let outside influences make your health and wellbeing come second always put your self first.
